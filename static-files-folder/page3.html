        <p>My name is Raied (Rye-ed) Shoaib (Show-Abe), and I am a Computer Science major at the University of Pittsburgh.
            I am from Mechanicsburg, PA which is in south-central near Harrisburg. I was born and raised in Pakistan, and I immigrated to the U.S. back in 2011. 
            I have one younger brother who is a junior in high school, and an Orange Tabby cat named <a style="text-decoration:none; color:#f4b977;" href="Mano.html">Mano</a>. I can speak three languages: Urdu (my native language), English, and Spanish (studied for 7 years). 
            
            <br><br>
            My main hobbies and intrests include watching and playing soccer, watching <a style="text-decoration:none; color: #df5c64" href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/sakigake" target="_blank">anime </a> (if you had not already guessed that from the backgrounds I used for this website), playing video games, 
            reading, watching TV-shows, movies, YouTube, and Twitch, hiking, and just having a good time with my friends. Some fun facts about me are that I have never broken a bone, I write in cursive which I learned back in third grade, and I am left-handed in sports. 
            <br><br>
            Academically, I am a junior pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science which I was introduced to back in ninth grade. 
            The final project for the introductory CS class in ninth grade was to create a game, and I ended up creating a 2d platformer which was well-recieved by classmates and my teacher.
            Taking that introductory course made me want to puruse CS as my major because seeing people enjoy something that I created from scratch was very rewarding to me. As an asprining software engineer, I want to work to create software and programs
            that will bring ease and happiness to people's lives. I want to have a diret positive impact on peoples' lives with my work, and I believe CS will allow me to achieve that. 
            <br><br>
            By taking this course, I hope to expand my knowledge on different digital media and gain new skills in creating and modifying digital media to my ideas and creativity. I also intend to use this course as a creative outlet
            as my other CS and math courses do not allow much room for creativity. The aim of this website is to act as a portfolio for the work I do in this course, and I think it will be a great tool for showcasing and reflection. 
            Overall, I am looking forward to what we do in this class, and I wish everyone the best of luck!
