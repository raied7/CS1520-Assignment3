        <p><strong>Statement of Goals and Choices For This Website</strong></p>
        <p>The overall aim for this website is to act as a portfolio for the work I do during this course, and since this course deals with the study of digital media, I shaped it around my personal experiences with digital media. One of the things I wanted to convey through this website was my admiration for Japanese animation, and I did that through choosing a different anime background for each page and color coordinating everything else on the page to match the background. The animes I chose to select backgrounds from are animes that I have seen and thoroughly enjoyed.  I feel that the rest of my projects in this course will take inspiration in one way or another from anime so the design of the website helps get that point across. The background of the main page depicts Bojji from the anime “Ranking of Kings”. Bojji is the protagonist of this show, and he is a deaf and mute character who gets cheated out of the throne because of his disabilities. The show follows his journey to become stronger, overcome obstacles, and reclaim his place at the throne. Although I personally do not have any disabilities like Bojji, I nevertheless feel inspired by his story and the resilience and courage he shows throughout the show. Despite everyone always looking down on him because of his disabilities, Bojji always has a smile on his face and he strives forward to better himself and help others. Bojji is my literal “hero image”, and even without any context of the show, the image conveys a sense of positivity and adventure which are two things I hope to experience throughout this course. Additionally, I want anyone who browses my website to feel a sense of adventure as they navigate through the different pages and projects, and they leave the website with a smile on their face.

            My bio introduces me beyond the surface level to the visitors of the website. It attempts to create some sort of connection by finding something in common with someone else. It lists who I am, where I am from, my interests and hobbies, my academic and professional goals, and my purpose for taking this course. The bio gives the visitors an insight on who I am and why I decided to design this website the way I did. The extra element I added was nine (nine lives) pictures of my cat Mano who is someone I hold dearly to my heart, and I think anyone with a pet will be able to relate to that sentiment. Even if the visitor does not have a pet, the pictures will nevertheless make them smile and hopefully feel somewhat connected to me. Overall, this site is composed of a lot of personal things and information    that are valuable to me, and by sharing that information, I hope to allow everyone to see my inspirations and motivations behind the work I do in this course which will be showcased on this website.

            I think this website does a good job to articulate who I am and to show what this works mean to me and the dedication and effort I put into it. The work I do in this course is important to me because I view it as my primary creative outlet. As a computer science major, I do not think most of the work in this course will intersect with my professional career (except this website), but it will nevertheless be valuable to me personally. Later on in life, I might reflect on the work done in this course to reminisce or to find inspiration for a personal project.

            As I mentioned before, I decided to use scenic anime backgrounds for the background of my pages. Since the backgrounds are a form of art, I also want my work to be viewed as art. I also color coordinated everything else on the page with the colors of the background, so that everything would flow smoothly. I gave each section of this website a separate page which gave me a blank canvas to use for every page, and I wanted each project to be viewed as a separate entity since each project deals with a different form of digital media. I do not know how I will fill in the placeholders for the projects yet because I have done no work on them, but as I start to work on them, I think I will be able to get a more clear picture of how I want to design the page. I can definitely see myself changing elements of this site as the semester progresses, specifically the background and the colors to better match the aesthetics of the project. I would also like to add interactive elements to my website using JavaScript if a project would flow smoothly with them.

            I did not find HTML and CSS too difficult because I have prior experience with it. I did not run into any significant problems, but if I needed to know how to do something or how to fix an element, I simply searched Google for my question or problem, and I was able to find a working solution by reading different articles and discussion posts on that topic. On the landing page, I wanted to assign the rgb class to the course name, but I was unable to implement that or find a solution for it without messing up the text layout of the entire page.
